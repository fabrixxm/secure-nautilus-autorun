Secure Nautilus Autorun - v0.1
------------------------------

secure-nautilus-autorun is a "extended" version of nautilus-autorun-software 
written in python.
Most of the code is a translation in python of original C code.

Differences
-----------

When secure-nautilus-autorun starts, search an autorun script according to
freedesktop specs (.autorun, autorun, autorun.sh ).
If it found one, search for <filename>.gpg, a gpg sign of autorun script.

If the sign doesn't exist or is not valid, secure-nautilus-autorun shows to the
user the same confirmation dialog as nautilus-autorun-software.

If the sign is valid, a note about signer and a button to show details of the
sign is added to the confirmation dialog.

If the sign is valid and the key used to sign is in user's private keyring,
the script is executed without confirmation
